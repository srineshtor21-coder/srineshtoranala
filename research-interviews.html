        <div class="interview-grid">
            <!-- Interview 1: Carlo Cuman -->
            <div class="interview-card">
                <h2>Carlo Alberto Cuman</h2>
                <p class="title">President and Strategic Digital Conductor</p>
                <p class="company">Wentech</p>
                <p class="date">Interview Date: October 21, 2025 | 4:00 PM - 4:40 PM</p>
                <p>Through my interview with Mr. Cuman, I gained powerful insights about green AI and its impact on the tech industry and environment. He explained how AI is currently using massive amounts of energy, which is a major issue for tech companies that must solve it themselves.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> A lot of energy is lost when transferred from power plants to data centers. Building energy stations closer to cities can provide less energy loss.
                </div>
                <p>Mr. Cuman has been in technology business for almost 40 years and provided unique perspectives on combining various ideas to form better solutions. He also introduced me to the concept of Marketech - marketing with emphasis on technology.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Interview 2: Mr. Goodfellow -->
            <div class="interview-card">
                <h2>Mr. Goodfellow</h2>
                <p class="title">AI Research Scientist</p>
                <p class="company">Google DeepMind (Previously OpenAI, Apple)</p>
                <p class="date">Interview Date: October-November 2025</p>
                <p>In my interview with Mr. Goodfellow, I learned how he creates AI simulations of fusion reactors for Google DeepMind. These simulations allow technical parts of the fusion reactor to be tested, like temperature and structure, for clean, renewable energy creation.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Project Feedback:</strong> He believed my original work idea could definitely reduce energy, as the energy usage of prompts has been studied extensively recently. He identified that measuring energy reduction would be a key challenge to overcome.
                </div>
                <p>Mr. Goodfellow provided multiple research articles and courses to help me learn more about building AI models, along with additional contacts for future interviews.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Interview 3: Mr. Vasireddy -->
            <div class="interview-card">
                <h2>Mr. Vasireddy</h2>
                <p class="title">PhD Student</p>
                <p class="company">University of Texas at Dallas</p>
                <p class="date">Interview Date: October-November 2025</p>
                <p>Mr. Vasireddy proposed a different approach to reducing AI energy consumption. He explained that the amount of computations a model uses is the main energy consumer, so researchers are currently trying to solve this through new coding architecture.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Technical Insight:</strong> My prompt reducer can reduce energy consumption by reducing the amount of computations the large model must undergo. This helped me understand how to expand my project to be more impactful.
                </div>
                <p>He provided valuable resources and additional professional contacts to continue my research journey.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Interview 4: Mr. Huang -->
            <div class="interview-card">
                <h2>Mr. Huang</h2>
                <p class="title">Data Scientist for Environmentally Sustainable AI</p>
                <p class="company">Google</p>
                <p class="date">Interview Date: December 2025</p>
                <p>Through my interview with Mr. Huang, I learned about how workers at Google are trying to lessen their energy consumption through various new techniques. I gained better understanding of how AI is growing to use more energy per day because of its unsustainable usage and creation.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Project Validation:</strong> My idea about token count in prompts affecting energy consumption is very accurate and represents the first layer of AI models. My original work could help people by reducing energy costs at the prompting stage and changing their lifestyles.
                </div>
                <p>He emphasized an important point: if we can change people's lifestyle and usage of AI, consumption can inherently be increased or reduced depending on the effects of the change.</p>
