                    <p class="lead">As we enter 2026, I'm setting my sights on making meaningful contributions to the field of green AI. This post outlines my research goals, the questions I hope to answer, and the impact I aspire to make through my ISM project.</p>

                    <h2>Reflecting on the Journey So Far</h2>
                    <p>The past year has been one of discovery and learning. Through preliminary research and conversations with professionals in the field, I've developed a deeper understanding of both the challenges and opportunities in sustainable AI development. Now it's time to put that knowledge into action.</p>

                    <h2>My 2026 Research Goals</h2>

                    <h3>1. Complete a Comprehensive Literature Review</h3>
                    <p>I plan to thoroughly review academic papers, industry reports, and case studies related to green AI. This will provide a solid foundation for my original work and help identify gaps in current research.</p>

                    <h3>2. Conduct Professional Interviews</h3>
                    <p>Learning from practitioners is invaluable. I aim to interview at least five professionals working in sustainable computing, AI research, or environmental technology to gain real-world perspectives.</p>

                    <h3>3. Develop Practical Tools</h3>
                    <p>Theory is important, but practical application matters more. My goal is to create tools or frameworks that developers can use to measure and reduce the environmental impact of their AI projects.</p>

                    <h3>4. Share My Findings</h3>
                    <p>Knowledge is most valuable when shared. I plan to document my research through blog posts, presentations, and ultimately my final ISM product.</p>

                    <h2>Questions I Want to Answer</h2>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>How can we accurately measure the carbon footprint of AI systems?</li>
                        <li>What trade-offs exist between model performance and energy efficiency?</li>
                        <li>How are leading companies implementing green AI practices?</li>
                        <li>What role can individual developers play in promoting sustainable AI?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Impact I Hope to Make</h2>
                    <p>By the end of this year, I hope to have created resources that help others understand and address AI's environmental impact. Whether it's a student working on a class project or a professional developing enterprise systems, I want my work to provide practical guidance for building more sustainable AI solutions.</p>

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Here's to a year of learning, growth, and positive impact. Let's make 2026 the year we start building AI with the planet in mind.</p>
