                <div class="post-content">
                    <p class="lead">As I begin my ISM research into sustainable artificial intelligence, I'm excited to explore how we can develop AI systems that are both powerful and environmentally conscious. This journey promises to reveal the delicate balance between technological advancement and ecological responsibility.</p>

                    <h2>Why Green AI Matters</h2>
                    <p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has brought tremendous benefits to society, from medical diagnosis to climate modeling. However, this progress comes with a significant environmental cost. Training large language models and complex neural networks requires enormous computational resources, which translates to substantial energy consumption and carbon emissions.</p>

                    <p>Consider this: training a single large AI model can emit as much carbon as five cars over their entire lifetimes. As AI becomes more prevalent in our daily lives, this environmental impact multiplies exponentially. This realization sparked my interest in Green AI—the pursuit of developing AI systems that minimize environmental impact while maintaining effectiveness.</p>

                    <h2>My Research Goals</h2>
                    <p>Through the ISM program, I aim to explore several key areas:</p>

                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>Energy-Efficient Algorithms:</strong> Investigating techniques that reduce computational requirements without sacrificing model performance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Carbon-Aware Computing:</strong> Understanding how to schedule AI workloads to take advantage of renewable energy availability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Model Optimization:</strong> Exploring methods like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to create smaller, more efficient models.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sustainable Infrastructure:</strong> Examining the role of green data centers and renewable energy in AI computation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
                    <p>This semester, I'll be diving deep into academic literature, conducting interviews with professionals in the field, and working with my mentor to develop practical approaches to green AI. I believe that by making sustainability a core consideration in AI development, we can ensure that technological progress doesn't come at the expense of our planet.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"The best way to predict the future is to create it—and that includes creating a sustainable future for AI."</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>I'm looking forward to sharing my findings, challenges, and discoveries throughout this journey. Together, we can work toward a future where artificial intelligence helps solve environmental challenges rather than contributing to them.</p>

                    <p>Stay tuned for more updates as I progress through my research!</p>
