                                <p class="interview-role">AI Research Scientist, Sustainable Computing Lab</p>
                                <time datetime="2026-01-10" class="interview-date">January 10, 2026</time>

                            <div class="qa-block">
                                <p class="question"><strong>Q: What first drew you to the field of sustainable AI?</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer">I started my career focused purely on improving model accuracy, but around 2020, I began to realize that the computational costs of our work were growing exponentially. When I saw the research on the carbon footprint of training large models, I knew I had to redirect my focus. Now I see efficiency and sustainability as just as important as performance metrics.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="qa-block">
                                <p class="question"><strong>Q: What do you see as the biggest challenges in making AI more sustainable?</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer">The biggest challenge is cultural. The AI research community has traditionally measured success by accuracy improvements, regardless of computational cost. We need to shift toward reporting and optimizing for efficiency alongside performance. There's also a practical challenge: we need better tools for measuring the true environmental impact of our systems.</p>

                            <div class="qa-block">
                                <p class="question"><strong>Q: What advice would you give to students interested in this field?</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer">Start by understanding the fundamentals of both AI and environmental science. Learn to think about systems holistically—not just the algorithm, but the hardware, the data center, the energy grid. And most importantly, don't be afraid to question the status quo. Some of the best green AI innovations have come from people asking "why do we need such large models in the first place?"</p>

                                <p class="interview-role">Senior Engineer, Cloud Infrastructure</p>
                                <time datetime="2026-01-05" class="interview-date">January 5, 2026</time>

                            <div class="qa-block">
                                <p class="question"><strong>Q: How is your company approaching sustainability in AI infrastructure?</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer">We're tackling it from multiple angles. First, we've invested heavily in renewable energy—our data centers are now powered by 90% renewable sources. Second, we've optimized our cooling systems using AI itself, which reduced cooling energy by 40%. Third, we're developing custom hardware that's designed for efficiency, not just raw performance.</p>

                            <div class="qa-block">
                                <p class="question"><strong>Q: What metrics do you use to measure sustainability?</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer">Beyond Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), we track carbon per inference for our AI services, water usage effectiveness for cooling, and the lifecycle emissions of our hardware. We also consider the "carbon payback period"—how long before an AI service's environmental benefits exceed the cost of running it.</p>

                                <p class="question"><strong>Q: What role can individual developers play?</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer">Individual choices add up. Use pre-trained models when possible instead of training from scratch. Choose appropriate model sizes for your task—you often don't need the largest available model. Profile your code for efficiency. And advocate for sustainability metrics in your organization's AI development process.</p>
